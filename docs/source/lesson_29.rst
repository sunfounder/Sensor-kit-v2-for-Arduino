Lesson 29 Laser Transmitter
===========================

**Introduction**

Laser is widely used in medical treatment, military, and other fields
due to its good directivity and energy concentration. The Laser
Transmitter module, as the name suggests, is a one that can emit laser.

**Principle**

A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical
amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic
radiation. Lasers differ from other sources of light because they emit
light coherently.

Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling
applications like laser cutting and lithography, and a laser beam to
stay narrow over long distances (collimation), enabling applications
such as laser pointer. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence
which allows them to have a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they only emit
light of a single color. And its temporal coherence can be used to
produce pulses of lightâ€”as short as a femtosecond.

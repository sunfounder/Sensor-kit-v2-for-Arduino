About This Kit
----------------

The Rollarm Kit for Arduino is designed for mass hobbyists to learn robot arm control. With the open source MCU Arduino UNO and a servo expansion board, you can control its four axes by the 4 potentiometer on the handle, as well as make them move by operating on your computer. In addition, it can memorize the movements it’s made and repeat again and again, making it a great tool for repeated tasks.In this book, you can learn the basics of how a mechanical arm works and how to make one piece by piece. For more information, please go to our website www.sunfounder.com and find the tutorial under Learn.
